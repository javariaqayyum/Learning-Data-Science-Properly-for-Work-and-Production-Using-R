## Theoretical Lessons Learned

Very First and basic thing I have learned what is EDA? 
The actual meaning of EDA like this is Exploratory data analysis. we need to understand and explore dataset bafore performing any sort of preprocess or data cleaning.
For example if we consider Jobsdata, first thing we did is to explore most important or most relevant variables by making tables getting thier values percentages and making g
graph visualization.
